##### 100% REMOTE

![Blockchain Core Developer - WFH Remote](https://og.spacemesh.io/content/images/size/w2000/2020/04/1.png)

Spacemesh is a [fairly mined](https://spacemesh.io/resources#faq-how-does-spacemesh-achieve-a-high-degree-of-decentralization) cryptocurrency that is [permissionless](#term:permissionless), trustless, secure, and [race-free](https://spacemesh.io/blog/race-free-consensus-based-on-proofs-of-space-time/). Spacemesh is built and distributed as [open-source software](https://github.com/spacemeshos) and all software work done for Spacemesh is contributed to the world under a permissive software license.

To get a full sense of our motivation, vision, scope, and values please [watch this whiteboard video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbvGEeHZmsg) with our chief scientist, cryptography professor Tal Moran. To learn more about the platform from a tech perspective, please see the resources [available here](https://spacemesh.io/resources).

If you want to work on a layer one project, and be at the forefront of the next major tech disruption – decentralized programmable money – apply to join us.

We are looking for an exceptional applied cryptography researcher to join our growing research team.

You will be able to enjoy

* A flat and fully remote structure, with team members in The United States, Italy, Ukraine, Israel, Germany, India, Taiwan, and more.
* Open source exposure
* Agile, sprints-based work methods at flexible hours
* Bi-weekly team updates
* Full responsibility for the quality and delivery of major platform components
* A chance to work closely with the Spacemesh world-class researches [Tal Moran](https://talmoran.net/) and [Iddo Bentov](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/\~iddo/)
* Working closely with the open-source community
* A tokens package and a competitive salary

## Responsibilities

* Evaluate the security and implementation correctness of open source crypto software components and libraries.
* Provide concrete recommendations for improving the security, implementation correctness, and quality of these components.
* Coordinate and incorporate feedback on tasks from other members of the Spacemesh research team.

## Sample Tasks

* Review the group arithmetic functions of a specific crypto library for implementation correctness of the theoretical constructs and operations, and recommend additional test cases to improve the library's quality.
* Review the implementation correctness and the security of a new key derivation algorithm for creating elliptic curve signature key pairs from a random seed algorithm, based on published research.

## Skills & Experience

* Excellent advanced math skills.
* Advanced degree in applied cryptography.
* Good familiarity with the latest academic research applicable to blockchain security and cryptography.
* Good knowledge of modern crypto primitives.
* Good understanding of elliptic curve based cryptography, in particular, signature schemes.
* Good knowledge of modern elliptic curve signature theory.
* Skillful in reading C/C++, Rust, and Go code.
