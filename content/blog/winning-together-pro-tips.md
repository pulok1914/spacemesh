#### Challenge Overview

When it comes to privacy, Web2 is fundamentally broken, but it's probably going to be sticking around for a while yet. What tricks have you picked up over the years to make your internet experience more private and secure?

Share your advice on the #pro_tips channel on the Spacemesh discord, following the format of

1. Platform (operating system, browser, application, or website)
2. Purpose (for example, anonymity, or improved privacy)
3. Step-by-step instructions

Your pro tip can be related to basic internet & browser security, or specific websites. Just make sure that you explain how to do it, or else the submission won't count. ;)

**Example:**

> Platform: Chrome browser
