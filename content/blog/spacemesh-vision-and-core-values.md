OUR VISION

**Create a fair cryptocurrency that is a global means of payment and a fair global infrastructure for tokenized apps, economies and communities.**

## Our Core Values

The Spacemesh community is committed to collaboration in striving for the optimal balance among: Fairness (to the little guy/girl), Security, Fair Distribution, Scalability, Innovation, Unity (measures to mitigate hard forks), Inclusiveness, and Tolerance.

## Fairness

To us, fairness means 1. the ability for anyone, anywhere, to participate in the network and generate economic returns for themselves and their family using existing, consumer-grade hardware and _without the need for excessive capital expenditure_; and 2. no economies of scale (or, diseconomies of scale) for mining pools, "whales," and other professional mining operations.

## Product Plan

* Lower the barrier to entry for participation and always be fair to the little guy/girl joining the network from home.
* Use a homogenous and a highly distributed global resource (i.e., storage) to ensure fair distribution of coins and a high degree of decentralization.
* Commit to the fairest possible transaction fees and a subsidy policy to support some free transactions.
* Be attractive to developers building app-based economies by focusing on scalability, security, programmability and low transaction fees.
* Build robust smart contracts and custom token capabilities, potentially with bytecode compatibility with Ethereum and other popular platforms.

## Coin Distribution Plan

* Coin distribution plan and Smeshing (mining) rewards set such that a supermajority of coin is distributed via validators. No public ICO.
* No capped coin supply so new validators can always join the network and participate in rewards.
* High inflation rate in first few years to make it attractive for Smeshers (miners) to join the Spacemesh network.

## Governance Setup

* Establish a Foundation, Association, or other independent governance institution accountable to Smeshers and other network participants.
* This institution maintains an independent, full client implementation and appoints a core dev team to maintain it. Meaningful participation in governance via "dev skin in the game."
* This institution has treasury management responsibilities and is mandated to only allocate coins to further the tech, economy, and community.

## Core Use Cases

* Create the platform to make Spacemesh coin (Smesh) the trusted global means of payment, with a high degree of coin and network distribution and low transaction fees.
* Create an open, general-purpose infrastructure For Technologists, Economists and Community Developers to collaborate in forming different ‘economunity’ tokens, governance models, policies, and bylaws.
