Spacemesh protocol presentation at [San Francisco Blockchain Week 2018](https://sfblockchainweek.io/).

We combine Proof of Space-Time (PoST) with a mesh-based permissionless consensus protocol. The mesh (layered DAG) does not rely on leader-election. Rather, we incorporate ideas from Byzantine agreement protocols to guarantee convergence to a consensus from any starting state. Our construction combines a local protocol that guarantees fast consensus on recent blocks, with a global protocol that guarantees irreversibility.
