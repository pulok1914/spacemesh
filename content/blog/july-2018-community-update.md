## Team

* We are focused on growing the core dev team. We now have 3 full time developers and 3 researchers on the team, and we are actively hiring and interviewing new candidates. We have [several open positions](https://spacemesh.io/join/) in our TLV HQ and beyond
* The core dev team is busy working on implementing the Spacemesh protocol and the Spacemesh node p2p infrastructure (peer discovery, gossip, etc...) We work in the open and in go-lang. Follow our progress on the [go-spacemesh](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh) github repo

## Community

* Dr. Iddo Bentov, our chief scientist, gave a presentation in [Master workshop - off the chain Berlin](https://binarydistrict.com/workshop/master-workshop-off-the-chain/) and participated in the event's awesome [State Channels Panel](https://youtu.be/B75OYynCnhE?t=1h34m7s)
* We have kickstarted our [open source funded issues program](https://gitcoin.co/profile/spacemeshos) with the [Spacemesh cosmic project](https://github.com/spacemeshos/cosmic) and we have several great developers from developing countries already collaborating on this project with us
* We have published [Proofs of Space Time ASICs](https://spacemesh.io/post-asic/) - a blog post that explains why it is highly unlikely we'll see POST ASICs and mining farms
* We gave an intro presentation about Spacemesh in the [SF Crypto Devs Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/SF-Cryptocurrency-Devs/events/251995229/) and engaged in a 2.5+ hours conversation with Bay Area blockchain hackers and builders
* In London this July? Dr. Iddo Bentov is going to give a [presentation about Spacemesh](https://2018.blockchain-workshop.net/talks.shtml#bentov) at the upcoming [Workshop on Blockchain Technology and Theory](https://2018.blockchain-workshop.net/) in the University of London on July 23rd
* We have reached 3,000+ project updates emails subscribes - thanks for your interest! You can subscribe to updates from the bottom of [https://spacemesh.io/](https://spacemesh.io/ "https://spacemesh.io/")

## Research

* Our research team is working on the fine details of the Spacemesh protocol and its security proofs. These details and proofs are going to be published in our next white paper and via academic publications later this year
* We are actively researching the Spacemesh smart contracts VM, programming language and developers toolchain

## Product and Design

* We have clarified and named our [Roadmap Milestones](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/wiki/Roadmap) and expended the [Spacemesh MVP1](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/wiki/MVP1) requirements
* We have published the specs for the [Spacemesh Cosmic Seed](https://github.com/spacemeshos/cosmic) - an open source universal app starter kit that is going to be used as the seed for the Spacemesh App and we have started to work with open source contributors on both projects
* We have published the initial requirements and UX for the [Spacemesh App](https://github.com/spacemeshos/app) - The Spacemesh full node dashboard and [Spacemesh Wallet](https://github.com/spacemeshos/app/wiki/wallet-visual-design). The minimal wallet will enable people to pay with Spacemesh Coins and to interact with Spacemesh smart contracts and tokens
