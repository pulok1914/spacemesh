Prof. Tal Moran will be live answering your questions on 31th of May at 12PM Eastern Standard Time!

To participate, introduce yourself and ask your question on this page. Please be nice :-)

Tal pioneered the concepts of [Proof of Space Time](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/035.pdf) and [Proof of Sequential Work](https://talmoran.net/papers/mmv13proofs-of-work.pdf) and is the author of the Spacemesh protocol.

Tal Moran is a faculty member in the School of Computer Science at the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya, which he joined in 2011. Previously he was a postdoctoral research fellow at the Center for Research on Computation and Society at Harvard University. He holds a Ph.D. from the Weizmann Institute of Science, advised by [Moni Naor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moni_Naor) (One of the inventors of Proof of Work and Ecash). Tal's research focuses on employing ideas and techniques from theoretical cryptography to design secure systems in the “real world.” He's also interested the foundations of cryptography and the theory of cryptography in general.
