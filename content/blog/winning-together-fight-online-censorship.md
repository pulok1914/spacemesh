> The Spacemesh Social Causes program is fighting censorship!

> In this drop challenge, we invite you to fight online censorship by monitoring blocked websites and apps worldwide. For this challenge, you will be using an open source, free software called OONI (The Open Observatory). Created by a technological nonprofit, OONI is a global community, measuring Internet censorship since 2012. To participate in the new drop for a chance to get special Spacemesh gifts, read the instructions below.

**If you'd like to learn more about OONI, read this** [**deck**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yqYNKtkBDWbxRCxpVuQc2wPGQHkSooF1/view?usp=sharing "deck")**.**
