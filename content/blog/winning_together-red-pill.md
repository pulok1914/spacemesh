> The Spacemesh Social Causes program is fighting for digital privacy!
>
> In this drop challenge, we're going to have you take the red pill and see what kind of information web2.0 apps store on you. This is how they decide which adverts to show you and what to pop up on your feed, so get ready to get to know yourself like Facebook does. Be careful: it’s a deep rabbit hole, and you might not like what you find at the end of it!

#### Challenge Overview

YOUR CHALLENGE, should you choose to accept it, is to show us how web2.0 apps store tons of information on users, and how to see or extract that data. Interesting submissions will earn their authors some cool swag packs, and the chance to win awesome prizes in the Red Pill Raffle.

**Below, we have provided an example that shows you exactly how much data Facebook stores on you, and how you can get access to it. Please use this as a reference for your submission. (You'll have to choose a different web2.0 service or app.)**

To start digging into the rabbit hole, log into your facebook account and go to:

Settings and privacy -> settings -> Your facebook information -> Download Your information -> your topics

Choose date range

If you want, you can get _all_ the info Facebook has on you. But be warned: it might take a couple of GBs on your device! If you want the lighter version for the challenge, click “Deselect all” and only mark “Your Topics” to download.

then scroll down and start the retrieval of your data. You will receive this message:

When your data is available you can view and download it from the “available files” section

Now you can see what Facebook thinks of you and your interests. Do these guys really know you better than yourself?
