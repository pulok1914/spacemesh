Spacemesh is a fairly mined cryptocurrency which is permissionless, trustless secure and race-free. Spacemesh is built and distributed as a full open source project and all software work done for Spacemesh is contributed to the world as a commons under a permissive software license.

To get a full sense of the project's motivation, vision and scope, please read this [intro blog post](https://spacemesh.io/blog/the-spacemesh-consensus-protocol/), watch or listen to [Spacemesh â€“ The Space-Time Consensus Blockchain](https://epicenter.tv/episode/291/), [Proof of Space Time and Better Decentralization](https://youtu.be/BjKBYIbrScM) and explore our [github repos](https://github.com/spacemeshos).

Come and innovate with us at the forefront of the next major tech disruption - programmable Internet money via decentralized consensus on computations.

The project is led by the Spacemesh core development team which includes developers who are committed full-time to the project as well as part time open source contributors and collaborators.
