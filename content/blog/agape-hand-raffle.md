### GUIDELINES

* To buy a ticket, make an $8 donation to [Agape Hand](https://gogetfunding.com/spacemesh/) using your discord username (# number included).
* If you make the donation amount public, your tickets will be automatically entered. If you keep it private, though, you'll need to DM the receipt to @**Chaim#0251** on discord.
* If you want to donate in ETH, DM @**Chaim#0251** first, for instructions. BTC donations aren't eligible for purchasing a ticket.
* **Remember: The more tickets you buy, the greater your chances to win.**
