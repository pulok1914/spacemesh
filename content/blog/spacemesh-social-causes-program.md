#### What is the Spacemesh Community Social Causes Program?

It's a way for us to do great things together, working together to make the world a better place. The plan is built around social causes Spacemesh believes in, and is full of stimulating events, creative challenges, underground activities, drops and rewards. The program is a living, breathing project, which you can both influence and participate in.

Read all the details below, and [join the new Discord channel ](https://discord.gg/B6eZjQVCDD " join the new Discord channel")to contribute and stay in the loop.

#### IT'S HOW WE ROLL

We are doomed if we do not change the old world order that brought us to this moment in history: where inequality is wider than ever, and the climate crisis is accelerating towards the point of no return. We’re building Spacemesh to help replace this _old world order -_ with its centralized power structures, with _a new world order_ - where power is decentralized.

In our vision, we see a just world, where power in all its forms is in the hands of the many. A world that distributes wealth fairly, and frees people to pursue their true passion, unshackled from financial necessity.

In this greater scheme of things, the Spacemesh technology is just a means to an end.

**And community, collaboration, art, activism and artivism are just as important as the technology.**

So while we build the Spacemesh vehicle for change, we don’t want to sit around and wait for change to come. We want to be the change we want to see in the world, and shine a light on it. The Spacemesh Community Social Causes Program is how we roll.

#### How To Participate:

Follow the updates on the new Discord channel; every two month, we will come together around a different Social Cause.

To participate:

1. **Join the program by posting #winning_together on the digital_privacy channel.** 
2. **Take part in on the Drop Challenges***. The drops are creative challenges we will drop along the way, with the chance to get rewards for participating. Stay tuned for the drops announcements in the discord channel.
3. **Attend the Community Events.** Open discussions and curated events will be held throughout each social cause cadence. This is your opportunity to engage, get inspired, and meet the other Smeshers winning together with you.

#### GO WILD WITH CREATIVITY

At the heart of this effort is creating for what we believe in. We want a world where people are free to pursue their true passion, unshackled from financial necessity. Whatever you want to make - make it. Our community will enable it. Reach out to [alon@spacemesh.io](mailto:alon@spacemesh.io "alon@spacemesh.io") with your idea.

> **P.S: We encourage you to follow the #winning_together hashtag.**
