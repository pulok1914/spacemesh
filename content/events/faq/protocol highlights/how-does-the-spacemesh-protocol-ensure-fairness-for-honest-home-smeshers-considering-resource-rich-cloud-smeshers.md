title = "How does the Spacemesh protocol ensure fairness for honest home Smeshers considering resource-rich cloud Smeshers?"

+++
In the short term, it might be profitable to mine Spacemesh Coins (Smesh) using both cloud-based VMs and at home using existing hardware. However, cloud Smeshing is less profitable than using existing hardware and Internet connectivity at home on due to the costs associated with cloud storage, operations and compute. In the long term, due to changes in the block reward frequency and the total storage committed to the platform, it might not be profitable to mine on the cloud, while Smeshing on an existing home system will remain profitable.

Although rich entities do get discounts on storage devices due to economies of scale (1), enterprise storage and cloud storage are more expensive than desktop storage (2). In addition, cloud Smeshers need to pay the costs of computation, memory and networking required to generate the periodic proofs required for participation in the consensus protocol. Alongside IT and cloud computing experts, we have modeled various possible attack scenarios that might be carried out by wealthy entities using cloud resources and have not been able to come up with an attack that favors such entities over honest Smeshers usin their existing home PCs.

(1)  _About 20% discount on bulk storage devices purchases._
(2)  _$90 per TB enterprise storage vs $27 per TB for home storage._
