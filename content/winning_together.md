Spacemesh is embarking on a new program to support causes we believe in, and you're invited to join us!

## **What is the Spacemesh Community Social Causes Program?**

It's a way for us to do great things together, working together to make the world a better place.

The plan is built around social causes Spacemesh believes in, and is full of stimulating events, creative challenges, underground activities, drops and rewards.

The program is a living, breathing project, which you can both influence and participate in.

Read all the details below, and join the new Discord to contribute and stay in the loop.

### **IT'S HOW WE ROLL**

We are doomed if we do not change the old world order that brought us to this moment in history: where inequality is wider than ever, and the climate crisis is accelerating towards the point of no return. We’re building Spacemesh to help replace this _old world order -_ with its centralized power structures, with _a new world order_ - where power is decentralized.

In our vision, we see a just world, where power in all its forms is in the hands of the many. A world that distributes wealth fairly, and frees people to pursue their true passion, unshackled from financial necessity.

In this greater scheme of things, the Spacemesh technology is just a means to an end.

**And community, collaboration, art, activism and artivism are just as important as the technology.**

So while we build the Spacemesh vehicle for change, we don’t want to sit around and wait for change to come. We want to be the change we want to see in the world, and shine a light on it. The Spacemesh Community Social Causes Program is how we roll.

## **How To Participate:**

Follow the updates on the new Discord channel; every two month, we will come together around a different Social Cause.

To participate:

1. Join the new Program Discord Announce you’ve join with hashtag #winning_together or find our moderators and DM them.

   Here you will stay in the loop with the current Social Cause, the events, the activities, the creative challenges and the drops and the insights. And here you sound your opinion and suggest causes and activities.
2. Take part in on the [Drop](https://spacemesh.notion.site/Testnet-0-2-Drops_Program-ba2384287b2c47bdaef96d3330fa1f55) challenges* \[and receive gifts!\]

   The drops are creative challenges we will drop along the way, with rewards for participating. Stay tuned for the drops announcements in the discord channel.
3. Attend the Community Events.

   Open discussions and curated events will be held throughout each social cause cadence. This is your opportunity to engage, get inspired, and meet the other Smeshers winning together with you.

## **TL;DR**

Spacemesh is launching a program for promoting various social causes we believe in. The community is invited to contribute, create, collaborate and get rewarded. Stay in the loop in the program [Discord](https://discord.com/).

### **GO WILD WITH CREATIVITY**

At the heart of this effort is creating for what we believe in. We want a world where people are free to pursue their true passion, unshackled from financial necessity.
