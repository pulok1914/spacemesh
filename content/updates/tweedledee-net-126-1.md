body = "<p>As part of the ongoing effort to investigate and respond to testnet issues, we’ve made great progress fixing issues that have arisen in the P2P (networking) stack, the Hare consensus mechanism, and elsewhere. Users should start to see the impact in terms of better UX starting with the next testnet.</p><p>We’ve added a new, more sophisticated type of logging, contextual logging, that adds a great deal of context to our logs and allows us to trace the path of an individual message or piece of data up and down the stack. This has already greatly facilitated debugging of the most complex issues (including the ones described in the previous bullet point).</p><p>We have an action plan for a much more sophisticated metrics collection and telemetry framework</p><p>We continue to make good progress on long-term, large-scale projects on the critical path to our next milestone, and mainnet, such as rewritten sync, verifying tortoise, and variable post</p>"
