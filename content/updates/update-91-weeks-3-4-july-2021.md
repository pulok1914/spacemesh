body = "<p>After much deliberation, we’ve decided the time has come to retire Tweedledee. As such, testnet 135 has been taken down.</p><p>We’ll be transitioning the testnet infrastructure to run the brand new 0.2 code over the coming weeks. We hope to introduce a new, next-generation Tweedledum testnet in the coming weeks, and we appreciate your patience as we complete the transition.<br><br>If you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to meet other smeshers, come be part of our <a href=\"https://chat.spacemesh.io\">discord server</a>.

body = "<p>A new dev workflow, focused on shorter sprints and more granular tasks, has allowed us to keep up the blistering pace of development on go-spacemesh. We <a href=\"https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/commits/develop\">merged roughly the same number of commits</a> in the second half of July as we did during the first half of the month.</p><p>With the completion of the <a href=\"https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/pull/2149\">new GPU PoST code</a>, we finished the 0.2 milestone. We are now one milestone away from our first mainnet release candidate.</p><p>We are testing the 0.2 code in an internal devnet, and will launch it on a public testnet as soon as it’s stable.</p><p>We’ve made several big improvements to sync, introduced safe layer math, fixed a memory leak in P2P, and streamlined how blocks are read from the database. As usual we’ve also made a slew of improvements to tooling, infrastructure, and testing.</p>"

body = "<p>We remain focused on finalizing the designs for transaction selection and rewards, and moving these into development for the 0.3 milestone.</p><p>We are also improving the design of the sync algorithm to make sync as efficient and safe as possible, including looking at <a href=\"https://people.cs.umass.edu/~gbiss/graphene.pdf\">Graphene</a> for set reconciliation.</p><p>Spacemesh relies far more heavily upon nodes being in agreement about time than do proof of work blockchains. We currently rely upon node operators synchronizing their node clocks using NTP, but we’ve begun to explore other possibilities, including baking a time sync mechanism into the Spacemesh protocol.</p>"
