body = "<p>We concluded preliminary research into economic models for coin issuance, and we’re discussing what our issuance/inflation function will look like. We’ll provide more information on this soon.</p><p>We discussed the consensus failures that occurred on the most recent testnets and proposed several tweaks to both parameters and logic to avoid these failures in future, such as reducing the maximum number of Hare iterations per layer, and making the Tortoise consensus process less reliant on Hare (for purposes of the testnet).</p><p>We’re continuing to study the design of account abstraction as implemented by other networks, and its suitability for Spacemesh, as part of finalizing our account and transaction model.</p><p>The team has been hard at work on their submission for the Crypto 2021 conference later this year.</p>"
