highlights = "<p>Our mission at Spacemesh is to build the most decentralized cryptocurrency that’s ever existed. With every passing week, we become more aware of how crucial this mission is.</p><p>In order for cryptocurrencies to live up to their real promise, they have to be censorship-resistant. While the underlying network, Ethereum, is decentralized, many of the applications running on it, including stablecoins like USDC, are not. <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/circle-blacklists-all-tornado-cash-eth-addresses-effectively-freezing-usdc/\">Circle’s recent blacklisting of Tornado Cash ETH addresses in response to sanctions by the U.S Treasury has proven that</a>, without true decentralization, censorship resistance is just a myth. And Ethereum’s imminent transition to proof of stake risks making it much more centralized, putting censorship resistance truly at risk.</p><p>This is why our work to build a truly decentralized, permissionless, censorship-resistant cryptocurrency platform is so important.</p><p>With this in mind, we’re very conscious about the factor of team cohesion. Our development team is fully remote and international, so this is a particular challenge for us. That’s why, in July, we brought our development team together in person so that they could get to know one another, helping them perform better as a team instead of a set of individuals. We also held a hybrid workshop session to discuss the most pressing problems that we see and came to a consensus on how to address them.</p><p><img src=\"/uploads/teamwork-1_2022-08-16.jpg\"></p><p>We’re also looking to expand our team with new hires: a <a href=\"https://spacemesh.io/careers/core-dev/\">golang developer</a> to join our core team, and a <a href=\"https://spacemesh.io/careers/developer-relations-evangelist/\">Developer Relations Evangelist</a> who will lead the charge to communicate Spacemesh’s technology to the wider world and make it accessible for developers in our community.</p><p></p>"

body = "<p>As our team transitions from an intensive R&amp;D phase to a testing phase, where we thoroughly test our code and infrastructure to prepare for genesis, testing tools become more and more important. To this end, we’ve created tools for more advanced testing of the network to ensure that it remains stable indefinitely. These include automating things like submitting transactions, adding/deleting nodes, verifying that nodes are synced, and introducing unpredictable “chaos” conditions. These tools will enable us to efficiently conduct the sorts of tests we need to prepare for genesis.</p><p>It’s essential that we find as many bugs as possible, and deal with the bugs we find with our automated testing tools. To that end, we’ve started regular, larger scale, and long-running tests to flush out bugs, and started adding more metrics for debugging performance and general monitoring.</p><p>To make Spacemesh as future-proof as possible, we’re also in the process of decoupling execution from consensus. In essence this means that the parts of the Spacemesh node that are responsible for executing smart contracts are totally separate from the parts that are responsible for coming to consensus on the canonical, ordered set of transactions in each block. While all smeshers will perform both tasks at genesis, this decoupling makes it easier to introduce different roles into the protocol in the future, and embrace a more modular future. For more on the topic of modular blockchain and why it’s central to the Spacemesh vision, we suggest watching <a href=\"https://youtu.be/M8-0IAsTp3c\">this talk</a> and reading <a href=\"https://rettig.substack.com/p/three-things-30-august-14-2022\">this recent article</a> by team member Lane Rettig.</p><p>Smapp development continues apace! We’ve released version 0.2.6, which comes with a new “report issue” button (to help the community to inform us of those bugs we’re looking for), as well as a host of <a href=\"https://github.com/spacemeshos/smapp/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed\">bug fixes</a>, such as recovering wallet from mnemonics and showing rewards in the transaction log. Now we’re working on catching and showing proper messages on system errors (which is mainly a problem on Windows), and starting up the node and smeshing on the Smapp startup if it was already configured previously. (For example, if Smapp is toggled to auto-start once the user’s computer boots up, then after system reboot it should start smeshing automatically, without a requirement to unlock the wallet.)</p><p>Our research team made significant progress finalizing the design of various aspects of the PoET protocol. As a recap, Spacemesh relies on PoET (proof of elapsed time) servers, which are separate from the main Spacemesh node, to allow smeshers to generate and submit proofs for the <em>time</em> part of the proofs of spacetime that underlie the protocol. In the past, there’s been difficulty in aligning PoET execution with protocol epochs, meaning that the PoET server completes the proof and then idles until the next round is supposed to begin. In mainnet, we'll want to control PoET more tightly by setting a precise completion time, in such a way that when it’s reached execution stops. Our research team has now <a href=\"https://github.com/spacemeshos/pm/issues/124\">devised a way of achieving this</a> with PoET ticks.</p><p>The research team has finalized a number of other critical outstanding designs over the past few days. One of these is the design of the “precompiled” smart contracts that we’ll include at genesis—a single-sig and multi-sig wallet, and a vesting account for coins belonging to early contributors—as well as the plan by which these initial accounts will be deployed, and the transaction format necessary to support these account types and use cases. Another is the <a href=\"https://github.com/spacemeshos/pm/issues/135\">design of GenesisID</a>, a feature that’s used to prevent cross-chain replay attacks and ensure that data originating from one network can never be broadcast successfully on another network. A third is the initial, genesis <a href=\"https://github.com/spacemeshos/SMIPS/issues/79\">nonce scheme</a>, which is similar to the “sequential integer”-type nonces employed by smart contract platforms like Ethereum, but allows gaps to accommodate the way the Spacemesh protocol orders transactions and selects blocks.</p><p>Finally, we’re very excited to share that we’ve finalized the details of the Spacemesh economic model, first <a href=\"https://spacemesh.io/blog/spacemesh-economics-intro/\">announced late last year</a>. The <a href=\"https://github.com/spacemeshos/pm/issues/151\">full specification</a>, which accounts for every single smidge, is available in <a href=\"https://github.com/spacemeshos/economics\">this repository</a>, where you can also find a table with issuance details for <a href=\"https://github.com/spacemeshos/economics/blob/main/tenyears.txt\">the first ten years</a>.</p><p><br></p>"
