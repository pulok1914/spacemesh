body = "<p>We’ve continued to make good progress on fixing issues including memory leaks and making under the hood improvements to core components such as sync, mesh, P2P, tortoise beacon, API, and database.</p><p>We successfully merged self-healing, the final big component to be included in the 0.2 milestone. This is exciting because it means that future devnets and testnets should be far more stable and more resilient to various issues.</p><p>We’re investing a lot of time and energy in making our build and testing environment (CI/CD) stabler and improving our testing infrastructure. We have a couple of team members dedicated to this task, but we’re looking to hire another. If you’re interested or know someone that might be, please check the <a href=\"https://spacemesh.io/careers/devops-automation-developer/\">posting on our website</a>.</p>"
