body = "<p>We launched a small experimental testnet for friends &amp; family on Feb 15th with a network of 325 full nodes, and have been running the network for the last 2 weeks.</p><p>It’s super exciting for team Spacemesh to onboard our first group of real users using their home PCs, see them Smeshing, transacting with each other, and getting Smesh from the testnet tap.</p><p>We got some great feedback on the initial release, and already improved the user experience of the Spacemesh app by eliminating some annoying network requirements via p2p improvements, giving users complete control over where to store their proof-of-space file, and providing more information for users about their Smesher status.</p><p>Here’s some of the feedback we got:</p><p><strong>“This is the smoothest UX i've experienced on a super early testnet”</strong></p><p><strong>“The visual feedback of this build is 10x better than the last, doesn't make you feel like it's just stuck”</strong></p><p><strong>“Just sent some SMD to someone. It works!!!</strong></p><p><strong>“I got my first smeshing reward!”</strong></p>"

It is experimental, has lots of bugs, and has a sub-optimal user experience - but it’s just the first iteration on our vision of home mining for everybody!</p><p><a href=\"https://testnet.spacemesh.io/\">Follow the white rabbit...</a></p>"
