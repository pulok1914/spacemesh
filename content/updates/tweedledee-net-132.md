body = "<p>We have a new <a href=\"https://github.com/spacemeshos/SMIPS/issues/49\">SMIP on Account Unification</a>, our candidate account model. It’s based on the Account Abstraction design from Ethereum, with modifications to support the mesh data structure.</p><p>We’re working on a “unified block” design that overcomes many of the challenges associated with the coordination problem of transaction selection in a mesh. It adds a step to the existing consensus process whereby participating nodes agree on not just a set of blocks and transactions to include in each layer, but also, how to order and aggregate those transactions into a single “superblock” per layer.</p>"
