body = "<p>Work continues on finalizing the Spacemesh economic and incentives model for genesis. We’re evaluating several novel economic models and studying the models adopted by other projects.</p><p>In parallel, we’re also working on finalizing transaction processing and selection. Transaction selection is much trickier in the mesh topology than in a chain since, rather than a single miner constructing a single block, there are many smeshers and many blocks per layer, hence it’s a distributed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem\">knapsack problem</a>. We’re evaluating a promising new proposal that cleverly avoids many of the challenges we face around transaction selection and ordering.</p>"
