body = "<p>The whole team has been focused on our upcoming open testnet launch in March. We are running an internal testnet, writing more tests and finding &amp; fixing more bugs so anyone can join our open testnet in a few weeks.</p><p>We published a big chunk of the Spacemesh <a href=\"https://github.com/spacemeshos/protocol\">protocol docs for developers</a>. This is an ongoing effort and additional guides are being added.</p><p>We published our updated <a href=\"https://github.com/spacemeshos/product/blob/master/product_plan.md\">2020 roadmap</a> on our road to mainnet.</p><p>We are finalizing a <a href=\"https://github.com/spacemeshos/product/blob/master/cli_wallet_spec.md\">CLI wallet</a> so people will be able to build a full node and the wallet from source code and join the testnet without using our reference GUI app.</p><p>We finished implementing and benchmarking a <a href=\"https://github.com/spacemeshos/gpu-post\">GPU optimized proof-of-space</a> library utilizing the new cross-platform Vulkan GPU compute framework as well as OpenCL and Cuda. The library now provides an optimized implementation for all popular PC GPUs such as Nvidia and AMD on Windows, OS X and Linux. This library is going to be used to setup proof of space time on home PCs without hogging the CPU.</p>"
