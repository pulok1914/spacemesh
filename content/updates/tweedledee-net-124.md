You can easily set up a local Spacemesh network on your dev box with locally-built Spacemesh software components or with released components on docker hub. Browse and search logs with Kibana, execute transactions with a CLIWallet, set up smeshing, and much more…</p><p>Launch a full Spacemesh network with 10 smeshers, on your computer with 2 lines of code:</p><p>npm install -g spacemesh-local-testnet</p><p>spacemesh-local-testnet create</p>"

body = "<p>We’re finalizing the design of our account and transaction model. We’re researching the work that Ethereum and other communities have done on account abstraction (unifying multiple account and transaction types into a single model) and evaluating its suitability for Spacemesh.</p><p>While the Spacemesh topology makes it harder to calculate and compare a single state root per layer (relative to a chain topography), we’re researching ways to do just this to immediately detect bugs that lead to state forks.</p><p>We’ve made good progress on economic research, including an analysis of Filecoin economics and issuance model and its applicability to Spacemesh. We’ll announce a candidate economic and issuance plan soon.</p><p>Research continues on an efficient algorithm for transaction selection, which is an especially difficult problem in Spacemesh due to the fact that it’s a distributed knapsack problem.</p><p>We’ve put a lot of thought into streamlining our R&amp;D pipeline to remove obstacles and ensure that we’re on the shortest possible path to genesis. We set up a <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/spacemeshos/projects/18\">new project board</a> that can be used to track the pipeline.</p>"
