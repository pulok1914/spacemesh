body = "<p>We successfully soft-launched Tweedledee - <a href=\"https://spacemesh.io/testnet/\">the first Spacemesh open testnet</a> - on March 1st. Since launch, we had over 100 people join the testnet from all over the world - mostly via word-of-mouth - and the network grew to about 700 p2p nodes from the 300 internally-managed p2p nodes to bootstrap the mesh. It currently runs about 440 full p2p nodes.</p><p>We started <a href=\"https://discordapp.com/channels/623195163510046732/667030437356503061\">getting great feedback</a> from the community and we have been busy fixing bugs and improving the network for the next app and p2p node update. Shout out to all who gave us feedback - you know who you are! Thanks to your invaluable input, we’re aiming to release a new minor app version with bug fixes in about 2 weeks.</p><p>We improved both the <a href=\"http://testnet.spacemesh.io/\">Testnet Guide</a> and the <a href=\"https://spacemesh.io/faq/\">Testnet FAQ</a> based on user feedback and common questions.</p><p>We onboarded devs who wanted to join the Testnet by building go-spacmesh and our CLIWallet directly from source code and improved the <a href=\"https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/releases/tag/v0.1.3\">joining documentation</a>. We started to launch proper releases of go-spacemesh and the Spacemesh app for the testnet view github releases.</p><p>We operated the <a href=\"https://discordapp.com/channels/623195163510046732/623196575191007232\">manual testnet tap</a> and got many testnet users some Smesh to start playing around with coin transactions before getting their first smeshing coin rewards.</p><p>We ran a survey of early testnet users and received valuable feedback which was largely positive. Although users acknowledged that it was a bit rough around the edges, they were pleasantly surprised by how smoothly it ran at such an early stage.</p>"
