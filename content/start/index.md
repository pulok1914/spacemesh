            This is the Smapp (Spacemesh App) which you can use to smesh from your
            home computer. 


            Smeshing is what we call mining. You smesh by committing space on your
            computer to the Spacemesh network, and receiving smeshing rewards in
            return. Once this space is committed, it cannot be used for any other
            purpose.


            In order to commit space to the network, you must generate Proof of
            Space data. This can be done using GPU or CPU, but it will be much
            faster and more efficient with GPU.

        - alt: Network
          body: >-
            In order to smesh, your node needs to be synced to the network. Syncing
            is a resource-intensive process which can take some time.


            In the Network screen, you'll be able to check your sync status and, in
            the event that you run into any problems, look at your log file.
