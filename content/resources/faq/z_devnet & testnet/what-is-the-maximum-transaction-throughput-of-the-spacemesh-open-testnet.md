title = "What is the maximum transaction throughput of the Spacemesh Open Testnet?"

+++
We set various protocol parameters in the Open Testnet to limit the base-layer growth rate and the amount of bandwidth required to download blocks, so home smeshers can use their existing hard drives and a fraction of a typical home Internet connection capacity to run testnet smeshers.

In Spacemesh 0.1 there is a hardcoded limit of up to 20 transactions per block and a target of 50 blocks per layer. This gives 0.1 a throughout of about 3 tx/sec.

For the Spacemesh 0.2 Open Testnet we plan to test a throughout of 66 tx/sec by increasing the transactions per block limit to 400. This is about 13x better than Bitcoin and 9x better than Ethereum's current actual transaction processing rate at full network capacity (1). The protocol is capable of supporting even higher throughput, which we will test in future releases of the Open Testnet prior to the launch of Mainnet.
