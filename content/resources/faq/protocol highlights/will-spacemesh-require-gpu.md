title = "Will Spacemesh require GPU?"

+++
Starting with Spacemesh 0.2, users will need one-time init process to smesh. This process can be done with a CPU, but that will take a long time. Using a GPU is faster and more energy-effecient. A GPU is not needed for smeshing after the initial setup is done and has no impact on your rewards for on-going participation. That is determined completely by the size of the space you commit when setting up smeshing.
