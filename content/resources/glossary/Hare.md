The Hare is a Byzantine-fault-tolerant consensus protocol that is used in order to get agreement about which of the [blocks](#term:block) in a given [layer](#term:layer) should be considered valid, and thus voted for, by all [Smeshers](#term:smesher). The Spacemesh protocol guarantees that blocks that are published on time will be considered valid.
