Non-interactive Proof of Space Time (in short, NiPoST) is a proof, given by a [Smesher](#term:smesher), that the committed disk space was used for the Spacemesh protocol over the designated period of time. Each Smesher needs to publish a NiPoST in order to become eligible to Smesh blocks, and keep on publishing NiPoSTs to maintain their eligibility.
