PoET (Proof of Elapsed Time) is a sub-protocol of [NiPoST](#term:nipost). It is the algorithm that measures time. The algorithm provides a proof that it has worked sequentially for a predetermined number of cycles, and thus proves that the period of time determined by its parameters has elapsed during its entire execution. PoET is not run locally by the [Smesher](#term:smesher); users query communal PoET servers.
