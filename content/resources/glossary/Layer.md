A layer is a set of [blocks](#term:block) published at the same time. Layers occur at fixed time intervals, e.g. 5 minutes. Immediately as every layer is published, its blocks are processed by the [Smeshers](#term:smesher), and their validity status is determined using the [Hare](#term:hare) consensus protocol.
