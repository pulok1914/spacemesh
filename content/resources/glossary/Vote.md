Each [block](#term:block) votes for the blocks in previous [layers](#term:layer) that it (or, more accurately, the [Smesher](#term:smesher) that generated it) considers 'valid'. If a block gets enough votes, it is included in the [ledger](#term:ledger). Blocks vote according to the [Hare](#term:hare) and the [Tortoise](#term:tortoise) consensus protocols.
