The Tortoise is a vote-counting protocol that is used in order to finalize [block](#term:block) validity. For each block, the Tortoise constantly tallies all the votes both for and against it. Once a confirmation threshold is passed, it announces whether the block is valid or invalid. The Tortoise protocol guarantees that [Smeshers](#term:smesher) will reach consensus, even if the Hare protocol fails.
