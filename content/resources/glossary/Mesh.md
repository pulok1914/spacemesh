Spacemesh uses a mesh structure as opposed to a chain. The mesh is divided into [layers](#term:layer), which are sets of [blocks](#term:block). As long as all blocks follow the protocol rules, they will be included in the [ledger](#term:ledger). By using a mesh, instead of a chain, Spacemesh can process a significant number of transactions within a given time frame. It also allows [Smeshers](#term:smesher) to receive rewards much more often when compared to block producers in a traditional blockchain.
