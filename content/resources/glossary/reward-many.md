Spacemesh is designed to inherent reward as many participants as possible in an equal way. Instead of enabling huge rewards to a small percentage of participants. This method negates net economies of scale. Thanks to operational costs, whales are at a disadvantage in comparison to home Smeshers, and there is no benefit to joining a mining pool.
