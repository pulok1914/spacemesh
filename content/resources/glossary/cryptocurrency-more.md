A cryptocurrency is just like any other currency, with three main differences:   
  
First, it’s digital; there are no coins or notes you can touch. Instead, it’s all on a computer. The second difference is that it’s decentralized. This means that there is no one central authority -- like a state or a bank -- that produces the currency, oversees it, or decides how much it’s worth. Rather it’s coined by its users, who can be numerous and anywhere. This is also the reason why users can transfer money directly from one to the other, without having to go through a central authority. And the last difference is -- and this is how crypto got its name -- cryptocurrency is encrypted. Which is how it can authenticate users and coins and transactions, again, without a central authority.
