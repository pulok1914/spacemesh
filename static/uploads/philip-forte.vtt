What's up, guys? My name is Phil Forte.

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:04.938
I'm super excited
to be a part of the Spacemesh movement.

00:00:05.106 --> 00:00:06.280
The vision behind the protocol

00:00:06.448 --> 00:00:08.540
is unlike anything else
in the blockchain industry,

00:00:08.708 --> 00:00:09.727
and it really aligns well

00:00:09.895 --> 00:00:12.874
with my original reason
for joining the blockchain space,

00:00:13.042 --> 00:00:15.992
which is returning self-sovereign rights
back to individuals

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.548
and prioritizing privacy

00:00:18.131 --> 00:00:21.231
in a time in which we don't seem to get
either of those things.

00:00:21.411 --> 00:00:22.650
Aspects of the protocol,

00:00:22.818 --> 00:00:24.919
some of the things
like Proof of Space Time

00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:27.710
and Spacemesh's race-free nature

00:00:28.297 --> 00:00:29.997
really ensure this moving forward.

00:00:30.851 --> 00:00:33.651
really excited to see
what's in store for the protocol

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:36.285
and really excited to be
a part of the community moving forward.
