Hello, Spacemesh.

2
00:00:03.671 --> 00:00:07.648
The reason I am looking forward
to Spacemesh is that

3
00:00:07.672 --> 00:00:10.042
there are a lot of problems with
the vast majority of the current

4
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:12.525
conventional proofs of work.

5
00:00:13.543 --> 00:00:16.533
Not only do they require
expensive equipment to be implemented,

6
00:00:16.557 --> 00:00:19.332
but they also consume
a lot of energy during operations,

7
00:00:19.356 --> 00:00:21.702
placing a heavy burden
on the environment.

8
00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:24.539
Resources are limited,

9
00:00:24.563 --> 00:00:28.720
and our ever-growing waste of resources
has a negative impact on our future.

10
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.358
To not shy away from the future,

11
00:00:31.382 --> 00:00:33.276
we need to change.

12
00:00:34.499 --> 00:00:37.458
Compared to conventional
proofs of work,

13
00:00:37.482 --> 00:00:40.147
Spacemesh consumes far less energy.

14
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.717
I believe the first step

15
00:00:42.741 --> 00:00:44.425
towards a new future

16
00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:45.966
begins with Spacemesh.
