Hi, I'm [?].

00:00:02.188 --> 00:00:04.371
a masters student
in electrical engineering,

00:00:04.539 --> 00:00:06.174
researching in the blockchain field.

00:00:06.342 --> 00:00:09.205
It was four years ago
that I became interested in blockchain.

00:00:09.373 --> 00:00:11.373
I thought it's a revolutionary technology

00:00:11.541 --> 00:00:13.897
and has the potential
to create a new social system.

00:00:14.072 --> 00:00:16.622
After that,
I've been involved in the technical side

00:00:16.832 --> 00:00:19.732
and have worked on solving the problems
of the blockchains.

00:00:20.163 --> 00:00:21.163
For me,

00:00:21.331 --> 00:00:24.077
Spacemesh is also a revolutionary platform

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.077
attempting
to make blockchains more decentralized

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.439
and remove barriers
for the ordinary people.

00:00:29.632 --> 00:00:32.832
I think we need platforms
to facilitate the process of adoption,

00:00:33.242 --> 00:00:35.442
and definitely,
Spacemesh can make it happen.
