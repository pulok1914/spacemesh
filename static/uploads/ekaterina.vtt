00:00:01.702 --> 00:00:04.632
Why have I, as well as
many other crypto enthusiasts,

2
00:00:04.683 --> 00:00:07.178
become interested
in the Spacemesh project?

3
00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:11.276
The answer is quite simple,
and that is the low barrier to entry.

4
00:00:11.327 --> 00:00:12.633
Virtually any user

5
00:00:12.684 --> 00:00:15.928
who has no professional skills
or in-depth knowledge

6
00:00:15.979 --> 00:00:20.308
can set up a miner on their computer,
and become part of a large system

7
00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:24.344
that may eventually become a mutually
beneficial economy in the future.

8
00:00:24.395 --> 00:00:26.100
The more users become familiar

9
00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:29.338
with the basic principles
of the blockchain technology,

10
00:00:29.389 --> 00:00:33.126
the more stable the chain
of the entire crypto industry will become.
