Hello, I'm Elf.

2
00:00:01.793 --> 00:00:04.938
It's great to share with you
a little bit about Spacemesh.

3
00:00:04.962 --> 00:00:08.515
For me, one of the things
that Spacemesh appeals to me most

4
00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:13.382
is that it allows everyone to
participate equally in mining.

5
00:00:13.406 --> 00:00:15.194
For today's
blockchain enthusiasts,

6
00:00:15.218 --> 00:00:19.066
they mainly focus on
speculating or selling coins,

7
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.218
They barely
mine a token of themselves.

8
00:00:24.242 --> 00:00:27.380
I think it's a pity.

9
00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:29.471
Spacemesh, on the other hand,

10
00:00:29.495 --> 00:00:32.801
is a great way to make up
for that for many people.

11
00:00:32.825 --> 00:00:33.966
I believe,

12
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.506
In the next one, two or five years,

13
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.236
whether you are a
newcomer or a veteran,

14
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:46.489
Spacemesh will make it highly possible
to genrate the first token of your own,

15
00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:49.659
just by using your PC.

16
00:00:49.683 --> 00:00:52.951
For that, I am very
optimistic about this project,

17
00:00:52.976 --> 00:00:55.406
and very excited about it.

18
00:00:55.464 --> 00:00:58.084
Well, good luck with SpaceMesh!
