00:00:00.939 --> 00:00:04.620
Spacemesh looks like a project
that can change the perception

2
00:00:04.672 --> 00:00:07.590
that blockchain technology
is something difficult

3
00:00:07.642 --> 00:00:09.647
and that it's not for everyone.

4
00:00:09.724 --> 00:00:13.224
In order to use cryptocurrency
and collect coins,

5
00:00:13.498 --> 00:00:16.959
there is no need
to keep your computer running

6
00:00:17.131 --> 00:00:20.685
for 24 hours a day
and use super-powerful hardware.

7
00:00:21.052 --> 00:00:26.452
To me, this literally means
that no matter who you are,

8
00:00:26.602 --> 00:00:31.819
a programmer, a businessman,
a housewife, a teacher,

9
00:00:32.086 --> 00:00:35.433
you can easily use
your cryptocurrency account

10
00:00:35.572 --> 00:00:38.191
and sometimes even receive rewards.

11
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.294
At the same time,

12
00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:46.592
there are no large entities in the system
like banks or organizations

13
00:00:46.736 --> 00:00:52.668
so we can be confident
that the process is secure and transparent.

14
00:00:53.194 --> 00:00:56.794
Spacemesh exists
thanks to ordinary people

15
00:00:56.888 --> 00:01:01.488
who can use it to the extent
they see fit.

16
00:01:02.101 --> 00:01:07.301
I believe that Spacemesh
has great potential

17
00:01:07.398 --> 00:01:10.941
and that this platform can be adapted
anywhere in the world.

18
00:01:11.195 --> 00:01:14.434
The main objective is to keep
the project equally accessible

19
00:01:14.486 --> 00:01:16.178
and easy to use for everyone.
