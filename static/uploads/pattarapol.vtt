-Hello, I'm Pattarapol.

2
00:00:02.838 --> 00:00:04.968
Today, I want to talk
about Spacemesh,

3
00:00:05.036 --> 00:00:06.983
which is an up-and-coming testnet.

4
00:00:07.051 --> 00:00:08.920
It is currently trendy

5
00:00:08.988 --> 00:00:10.905
because it is a testnet
that addresses

6
00:00:10.973 --> 00:00:12.827
the problems of the blockchain world

7
00:00:12.895 --> 00:00:14.446
using new concepts.

8
00:00:15.016 --> 00:00:18.926
After trying out the testnet

9
00:00:18.994 --> 00:00:22.340
and studying the various
concepts of Spacemesh,

10
00:00:22.408 --> 00:00:26.981
I feel that Spacemesh is likely
to experience further growth

11
00:00:27.049 --> 00:00:28.075
in the future

12
00:00:28.143 --> 00:00:31.129
and it will revolutionize
the blockchain industry as well.

13
00:00:31.583 --> 00:00:34.055
One thing that I like
about Spacemesh is that

14
00:00:34.123 --> 00:00:37.375
Spacemesh provides the opportunity
for people all over the world

15
00:00:37.451 --> 00:00:42.007
to join the project
and become part of the solution.

16
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.320
Very simply,

17
00:00:43.388 --> 00:00:44.860
by using their PC

18
00:00:44.928 --> 00:00:47.818
or any computer resources
that they have,

19
00:00:47.886 --> 00:00:49.263
no matter how much or how little,

20
00:00:49.331 --> 00:00:50.854
they can participate as well.

21
00:00:51.232 --> 00:00:56.090
This is the key that will empower
everyone to enter this industry.

22
00:00:56.283 --> 00:00:57.887
Anyway, if you're interested,

23
00:00:57.955 --> 00:00:59.718
don't forget to follow Spacemesh.
