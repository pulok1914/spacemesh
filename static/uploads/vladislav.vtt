Hello, everyone. My name is Vladislav,
and I am from Kazakhstan.

2
00:00:05.355 --> 00:00:08.743
I believe in cryptocurrency
and I believe in blockchain,

3
00:00:08.837 --> 00:00:12.556
and I think that a great
and bright future lies ahead of it.

4
00:00:12.777 --> 00:00:16.777
I am currently participating
in the Spacemesh Testnet,

5
00:00:16.918 --> 00:00:19.218
and I am very happy
to be part of this testnet.

6
00:00:19.385 --> 00:00:20.485
Honestly.

7
00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:24.696
Spacemesh wants to create
the most trusted

8
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.335
and the fairest
cryptocurrency in the world

9
00:00:27.386 --> 00:00:30.486
and hand it over to us, the people,
so that we, the people,

10
00:00:30.553 --> 00:00:35.353
are free of paying rubles,
dollars, euros, or tenge for it.

11
00:00:36.905 --> 00:00:43.356
Spacemesh wants to ensure
that everyone is equal.

12
00:00:43.934 --> 00:00:46.249
In short, Spacemesh means

13
00:00:46.383 --> 00:00:50.900
decentralization,
integrity, and equality.
