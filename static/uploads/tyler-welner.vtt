Hi, my name is Kyler from BlockVenture.

00:00:03.227 --> 00:00:04.227
I'm really excited

00:00:04.395 --> 00:00:07.745
to be a part of the Spacemesh community
and seeing the project grow.

00:00:07.913 --> 00:00:10.563
There's really two things
that drew me to the project.

00:00:10.738 --> 00:00:12.089
One, the technology.

00:00:12.257 --> 00:00:14.256
Everything they're doing
with Proof of Space Time

00:00:14.424 --> 00:00:15.719
is truly revolutionary,

00:00:16.344 --> 00:00:19.957
creating a more fairly mind crypto asset,
being at the heart of that.

00:00:20.176 --> 00:00:22.026
The second thing being the community.

00:00:22.194 --> 00:00:24.064
Just witnessing this early

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:26.879
rebellious group of psycho punks
come together,

00:00:27.047 --> 00:00:28.743
and a bunch of dabs

00:00:29.186 --> 00:00:32.284
creating this fairly mind, commissionless,
low barrier

00:00:32.452 --> 00:00:33.714
to entry crypto asset.

00:00:33.882 --> 00:00:35.060
I think
they're going to do a lot of big things

00:00:35.228 --> 00:00:37.171
and I'm excited
to be a part of the community.
